Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder causing memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. Diagnosis involves medical history, cognitive tests, and, in some cases, brain imaging. While there is no cure, ongoing research seeks to develop effective treatments. Predictive modeling using machine learning involves creating a model to predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's based on specific input features.
We've opted to analyze the "predict_alzheimers" dataset, encompassing diverse demographic and clinical characteristics related to Alzheimer's disease. This dataset comprises 33 columns, encompassing both categorical and numerical data.
Data Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing plays a pivotal role in readying data for machine learning models. This process encompasses understanding the dataset, rectifying missing values and outliers, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features, and conducting feature engineering. Furthermore, it entails data splitting, tackling class imbalances, handling text data, as well as normalizing and checking data skewness, while meticulously documenting all preprocessing steps. The specific actions undertaken depend on the dataset's characteristics and the machine learning task's requisites, often involving iterative refinement based on model performance. Initially, we planned to preprocess the data by addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. However, since our dataset contains no missing values, there is no need for data cleaning.

Regression:
The objective is to utilize machine learning regression techniques for predicting cognitive decline, focusing on a target variable with clinical relevance to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline. The target variable should display substantial correlations with multiple features, suggesting their potential predictive value for changes in the target variable. In light of these criteria, MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) scores (mmse.bl) are commonly employed as a standard cognitive function measure in Alzheimer's disease research, demonstrating broad clinical relevance. Following their statistical significance concerning the target variable (MMSE baseline score), the features nlabel, adas13.bl, cdrsb.bl, adas11.bl, faq.bl, and ravlt.immediate.bl are identified as the top six features for predicting cognitive decline. This selection indicates their potential as robust predictors of cognitive decline and underscores their importance in regression analysis.

We have explored several regression models—linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, and ridge regression—to forecast cognitive decline using our dataset. 

The Linear Regression Model demonstrates moderate predictive capability, yielding an R-squared value of 0.6439, signifying that approximately 64.39% of the variance in the target variable is accounted for by the model. Its RMSE of 1.7166 indicates that, on average, predictions are within about 1.71 units of the actual values. 

Surpassing the Linear Regression model, the Random Forest Regressor exhibits superior performance, boasting a higher R-squared value of 0.6632, suggesting it can explain around 66.32% of the variance. Moreover, its RMSE is lower at 1.6694, indicating more precise predictions.

In contrast, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) Model displays notably inferior performance compared to the other models, with an R-squared value of 0.6163. This indicates it can only elucidate approximately 61.63% of the variance in the target variable, with its higher RMSE of 1.7819 implying less accurate predictions. 

Similarly, the Ridge Regression Model shows performance akin to the Linear Regression model, yielding an R-squared value of 0.644. This indicates it can account for about 64.4% of the variance in the target variable, with its higher RMSE of 1.716 suggesting less precise predictions.

Based on these observations, the Random Forest Regressor emerges as the most favorable model for this task, effectively balancing predictive precision and the capacity to explain variance in the target variable. Conducting a feature importance analysis for the Random Forest Model reveals that 'nlabel' stands out as the most influential feature for predicting cognitive decline among the top 10 features chosen for prediction.

Clustering:

We believe that utilizing clinical scores such as the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scales, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and Functional Activities Questionnaire score can be beneficial in identifying subgroups of patients with similar disease severity or cognitive function. Employing the elbow method, we determined the optimal number of clusters to be three. Subsequently, we computed the silhouette score for four distinct clustering techniques—K-means, Agglomerative, Mini batch K-means, and mean shift—to classify patients into these three clusters. The silhouette score gauges the similarity of an object to its assigned cluster in comparison to other clusters. A higher silhouette score signifies superior clustering performance, with a score nearing 1 indicating a perfect match. 

Based on the scores, K-Means exhibits the highest silhouette score, indicating its suitability as the most appropriate clustering method for this dataset among those examined. The scatter plots depicted the clustering outcomes for each method (K-Means, Agglomerative, Mini-Batch K-Means, and Mean-Shift) after reducing the dimensionality of the clinical scores data to two principal components for enhanced visualization. Each point denotes a patient, with cluster assignments indicated by distinct colors.

Classification:

The task is to classify whether an individual has Alzheimer’s disease or not using machine learning for binary classification. Our steps include collecting a relevant dataset, exploring its structure, preprocessing by handling missing values and outliers, encoding variables, and splitting data into training and testing sets. We will choose an appropriate classification algorithm, train the model, and evaluate its performance using metrics. Optionally, we would like to tune hyperparameters for optimization, interpret model decisions and validate predictions. 

We assessed the accuracy of five classification models: logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machine, and naive Bayes. By employing both the elbow method and Grid Search CV, we determined the optimal k value for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to be 8. This refinement ensures a finely tuned model that maximizes predictive accuracy for our dataset.

Among the models tested, the naive Bayes classifier exhibited the highest accuracy, achieving 74.4%, rendering it the most effective model for this task. The notably high accuracy of the Decision Trees model suggests potential overfitting to the training data, thereby diminishing its reliability on unseen data. The success of the naive Bayes model may stem from its adeptness at managing independence assumptions between features, a trait that appears well-suited to this particular dataset.
